Smells Like
===========

This was a phase zero Dev Bootcamp project building a responsive website by following along with a Treehouse tutorial.  Nothing spectacular, just an exercise in modern web design practices.

The smells_like_bakin site was created by following the tutorial to the letter and building it.  The smells_like_teen_spirit site is simply a modification of the earlier site done to show off both my knowledge of HTML/CSS and my unusual sense of humor.
