	  	<h2>Something quirky about me</h2>
	  	<p>I work in a call center located on a former Air Force base recently named one of the <a href="http://mysteriousheartland.com/top-10/top-10-creepiest-abandoned-places-in-illinois/">Top 10 Creepiest Abandoned Places in Illinois</a>.  This is a shot of the old powerplant and watertower.  After this was taken the water tower was painted sky blue, which is a great color for a tall structure located near a small commercial airport with a lot of low flying aircraft.</p>

      <h2>Some things I love</h2>
      <p>I have two cats, or rather I am the personal servent of two cats.  The black one on top is named Tim and as you can see, he has a really hard time relaxing.  The little lady below him is named Naria and she is a princess in every sense of the word.  I brought her home years ago after she showed up at an old girlfriends house.<p>

      <h2>Inside my head</h2>
      <p>I have plenty of extra space in my head so I like to keep a small flashlight in there for emergencies.  Just kidding, I keep my flashlight on my keyring along with my <a href="http://www.leatherman.com/20.html">Leatherman</a>.  My head is filled with my amazing brain.</p>
